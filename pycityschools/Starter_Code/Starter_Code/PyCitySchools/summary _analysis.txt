Our tables and data included list of grades for math and reading courses. We had the students ID and names, school names, types, scores, budgets, etc.. . Using this data, we calculated the average of the scores and created Dataframes to show case the results. Then we created another Data frame and compared each school to another based on their average performance percentages and how whuch area has affected these performances.
We can conclude that our analysis shows a clear pattern between the size of a school and its performance. A schools average score drops as the size of it grows. also, we would assume that the more budget a school spends the better results they would get, but, in our tables, we find that, schools with lower budget have higher scores than others regardless of the schools size or type.
